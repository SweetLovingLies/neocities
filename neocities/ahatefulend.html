          <h1>Welcome to Planet Pearlia</h1>
          <p>Welcome to the end of my art project. I began working on this site in hopes to escape the cesspool of social media as well as having a place to practice my web design skills. It has become more than that. I'm glad you have chosen to join me in that journey by visiting. Thanks, I mean that.</p>
          <p>I also hope for this site to be a place where you can learn a thing or two about mental health, so please feel free to take a look at how I do things. Although I admit that I'm not the greatest at taking care of myself, I do my best to remain as functional as possible, and I'm always looking for ways to improve and declutter my brain. I try to keep things clean and healthy to make sure things are easy to understand but if it's not clear to you, I'm sorry. I'm always down to help people learn to take better care of themselves, because I've received much help, and some of it has worked for me, and some of it has not. Maybe some of the things I say here will help you too.</p>
          <p>Although this site will always be a work in progress, I hope you can enjoy what I'm building, as well as empathize with the multiple individuals behind it. <b>All good faith identities, please proceed with caution here.</b></p>

          <p> 
           Here is where art meets the mind. The true OMORI shrine, so to speak. <br>
           The game helped me learn how to come to terms with things in a more healthy manner. Because of how well my life paralleled with SUNNY's, I started to realize just how unhealthy closing up and forgetting everything actually is; this is how I'm opening up. The internet is the only safe space I have. I tried therapy, I tried talking things out with my family, and I tried physical journalling. It never worked; only caused more pain. This will be my journal. It's the only thing I have right now.
