      <p> OMORI is a surreal psychological horror RPG Maker game developed by OMOCAT and co-published by PLAYISM which fully released for PC Windows and macOS on December 25, 2020. </p>

        <h1 class=topheader>So, why OMORI?</h1>
        <p> I discovered OMORI around 3 years ago when a friend mentioned it to me while I was looking for more UNDERTALE-like content. At first, I was very skeptical of the game because I doubted I was in the right mindset to play a game concerning suicide, but I went through with playing it anyway. I'd argue that was the BEST decision I've ever made.</p>
          <p> The game hit me like a truck. I loved every single character, with all of their quirks and queries. KEL was the first deuteragonist character I warmed up to, but the rest came along quite quickly. MARI ended up becoming a globally loved character within my system and even ended up being introjected not too long ago!</p>
          <p> But none of them hit me as hard as SUNNY did. The longer I played, the more attached I grew to SUNNY's whole existence. Things paralleled far too well with my life and I ended up starting to question shit about myself. By the end of the game I became the only SUNNY kinnie within my system; as far as I know, at least. </p>
          <p> As funny as it is, my friends were quite alarmed by my immediate attachment to SUNNY of all characters and I ended up with a boatload of questions about me by the end of my playthrough. No comment. LOL</p>

          <p> I really REALLY want to learn how to do art in OMORI style. I absolutely suck at drawing overall though so that might be a while...</p>
